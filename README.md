## Salve and Servus!

I'm Rouven, a working student balancing IT operations, QA, and his studies, while also messing around in front-end development and web design when I find the time. If that sounds like a lot— well, it is. But I wouldn't have it any other way.

### What I Do

By day, I handle QA and IT operations, making sure that things run smoothly. 
By night (or whenever the caffeine kicks in), I build websites and video games as personal projects.

#### My Work Philosophy

- build small, build well, then scale
- minimise liabilities, maximise functionalities
- clear responsibilities lead to better results

I'm a big advocate for lean, lightweight, and maintainable development. Good software doesn't need excess bloat to keep up with modern competition.

### What I'm Good At

- Quality Assurance and Testing — because bugs belong in the forest, not production
- UI/UX and Design — clean, effective, and user-friendly
- Front-End Development — creating a smooth experience that looks well and works for as many customers as possible
- Critical Thinking — because the best solutions often aren't the most obvious or the most common ones and I'm here to create a better standard, not follow the status quo

### A Few Fun Things

- Caffeine-fuelled night-time coder with a fable for Linux
- History Nerd
- Creative Writer — if I'm not coding, I'm probably writing and building worlds with words
- Big believer in «less noise, more function»
